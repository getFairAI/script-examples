** What is the relationship between the number of ARBs that projects requested and their success in the LTIPP program? **

Based on the provided data, I analyzed the results and grouped the projects by the amount of ARB grants they received (Note: The exact amounts of ARB grants are not provided in the text, so I assumed that the projects can be grouped based on the scale of their operations and the reported metrics). Here is a short report: **Small-scale projects (<$100k ARB grant)** * Bedrock: 25,850% increase in uniETH balance, with an additional 0.021 uniETH per ARB utilized. * Origin Protocol: 4,800% increase in wOETH balance, with an additional 0.011 wOETH per ARB utilized. * StaderLabs: 3,170% increase in ETHx balance, with an additional 0.008 ETHx per ARB utilized. These projects showed impressive growth rates, but the absolute numbers are relatively small. They seem to have efficiently utilized their grants, achieving significant percentage increases in their respective token balances. **Medium-scale projects ($100k-$500k ARB grant)** * Lido: 39% increase in wstETH balance, with an additional 0.033 wstETH per ARB utilized. * Mountain Protocol: 82% increase in USDM balance, with an additional 9 USDM per ARB utilized. * Threshold Network: 176% increase in tBTC balance, with an additional 0.0003 tBTC per ARB utilized. These projects demonstrated moderate growth rates and achieved some notable increases in their token balances. Lido's results seem to be holding up well after the LTIPP ended. **Large-scale projects (>$500k ARB grant)** * Gyroscope: $262 TVL gain per dollar of ARB utilized, with a 273% increase in daily volumes. * Reserve Protocol: $18 TVL gain per dollar of ARB utilized, with a 220% increase in TVL. These projects showed significant growth in terms of TVL and volumes. Gyroscope's results are particularly impressive, with a high TVL gain per dollar of ARB utilized. Reserve Protocol also demonstrated notable growth. **Patterns and observations** * Projects that focused on token balance growth (e.g., Bedrock, Origin, StaderLabs) tended to show higher percentage increases, but smaller absolute numbers. * Projects that focused on TVL growth (e.g., Gyroscope, Reserve Protocol) showed more significant absolute growth, but often with lower percentage increases. * The efficiency of ARB utilization varied widely between projects, with some achieving much better results per dollar spent. Please note that these findings are based on limited data and should be taken as preliminary observations rather than definitive conclusions.

** What is the relationship between the categories in which projects fall and their results in the LTIPP program? **

**Report: Analysis of LTIPP Results by Category** After analyzing the results of the LTIPP program, we grouped the projects into three categories: Liquid Staking Protocols, Stablecoins/Yield-Bearing Tokens, and Tokenized Assets. Here are our findings: **Liquid Staking Protocols (Lido, StaderLabs, Stakewise)** * These protocols underperformed expectations mid-LTIPP but recovered by the end. * Lido's wstETH balance increased 39%, while StaderLabs' ETHx balance grew 3,170%. * Most ETHx supply on Arbitrum was bootstrapped during LTIPP, with 2k ETHx retained post-LTIPP. **Stablecoins/Yield-Bearing Tokens (Mountain Protocol, Reserve Protocol)** * These projects saw significant TVL growth: Mountain Protocol's USDM balance increased 82%, while Reserve Protocol's TVL grew 220%. * However, Mountain Protocol's TVL was impacted by large, infrequent jumps, suggesting whale activity rather than organic growth. **Tokenized Assets (Bedrock, Gyroscope, Origin Protocol, Threshold Network)** * These projects saw significant adoption and utility growth: Bedrock's uniETH balance increased 25,850%, while Gyroscope's TVL grew from $2M to $17M. * Threshold Network's tBTC balance on Arbitrum increased 176% during LTIPP, with continued momentum post-LTIPP. **Key Takeaways** * Liquid Staking Protocols took time to gain traction but ultimately performed well. * Stablecoins/Yield-Bearing Tokens saw significant TVL growth, but some projects were impacted by whale activity. * Tokenized Assets saw widespread adoption and utility growth, with some projects demonstrating continued momentum post-LTIPP.

** What are the top 5 projects that have achieved success based on what they specified in their grant proposals? **

After reviewing the data, here are the top 5 projects that have achieved success based on what they specified in their grant proposals: 1. **Gyroscope**: Gyroscope saw a massive 725% increase in TVL (from $2M to $17M) and a 273% increase in daily volumes, reaching approximately $2M. This translates to a TVL gain of $262 per dollar of ARB utilized. 2. **Origin Protocol**: Origin saw a 4,800% increase in the 7D MA balance of wOETH on Arbitrum (from 42 tokens to 2,041 tokens). This is an impressive growth metric that indicates strong adoption and utility of wOETH on Arbitrum. 3. **uniETH**: uniETH's 7D MA balance increased by 25,850% (from 20 tokens to 5,301 tokens), which is a staggering growth rate. This translates to an additional 0.021 uniETH per ARB utilized. 4. **Lido**: Lido saw a 39% increase in the 7D MA balance of wstETH on Arbitrum (from 63,000 tokens to 88,000 tokens), which is a solid growth metric that indicates increasing adoption and utility of wstETH on Arbitrum. 5. **StaderLabs**: StaderLabs saw a 3,170% increase in the 7D MA balance of ETHx on Arbitrum (from 62 tokens to 2,013 tokens). This is another impressive growth metric that indicates strong adoption and utility of ETHx on Arbitrum. These projects have demonstrated significant success in achieving their goals as outlined in their grant proposals.

** What do the most successful projects have in common, considering the objectives they set in their grants? **

After reviewing the grant goals, I found the following common patterns among the successful projects: 1. **Specific and measurable TVL growth targets**: Each project set clear and achievable TVL growth goals, which helped focus their efforts and measure progress. 2. **Incentivization strategies**: All projects employed incentivization strategies, such as tiered rewards, liquidity incentives, or loyalty programs, to attract and retain users and liquidity providers. 3. **Focus on user engagement and retention**: Projects prioritized long-term user engagement and growth in TVL, rather than solely focusing on short-term gains. 4. **Partnerships and ecosystem integration**: Many projects aimed to establish partnerships with key DeFi platforms, leverage existing infrastructure (e.g., DEXes and vaults), or develop strong liquidity networks within the Arbitrum ecosystem. These patterns suggest that successful projects in the LTIPP shared a focus on setting clear growth targets, implementing effective incentivization strategies, prioritizing user engagement and retention, and integrating with the broader ecosystem.

** How does DeltaPrime perform compared to similar projects? **

Based on the project descriptions, I categorized the projects into three groups: 1. **TVL growth incentivization**: Gyroscope, Reserve Protocol, and DeltaPrime 2. **Adoption and utility of specific tokens**: Lido (wstETH), Origin Protocol (wOETH), StaderLabs (ETHx), Stakewise (osETH), and Threshold Network (tBTC) 3. **Yield-bearing stablecoin growth**: Mountain Protocol (USDM) Comparing DeltaPrime's performance to other projects in the same category (TVL growth incentivization): * **Gyroscope**: 7D MA TVL increased from $2M to $17M, a gain of $262 per dollar of ARB utilized. Gyroscope bootstrapped their TVL during LTIPP and retained it post-LTIPP. * **Reserve Protocol**: 7D MA TVL increased 220%, from $3M to $9.5M, a TVL gain of $18 per dollar of ARB utilized. * **DeltaPrime**: According to Token Guard's analysis, DeltaPrime experienced a 300% increase in TVL during the promotion period, which dropped to 150% of the baseline after the promotion ended. While DeltaPrime showed significant growth during the promotion period, its TVL increase was not as substantial as Gyroscope's. However, it outperformed Reserve Protocol in terms of percentage growth. Additionally, unlike Gyroscope, DeltaPrime's TVL did not retain its peak value post-LTIPP. It is worth noting that Token Guard's analysis also reported a 400% increase in unique users and interactions during the promotion period for DeltaPrime, which returned to baseline after the promotion ended. This suggests that DeltaPrime's growth was driven by user engagement, but it was not sustainable without continued incentivization. In conclusion, while DeltaPrime demonstrated notable growth during the LTIPP, its performance was mixed compared to other projects in the same category. Its TVL increase was lower than Gyroscope's, but higher than Reserve Protocol's. The project's inability to retain its peak TVL value post-LTIPP is a concern, suggesting that continued incentivization may be necessary to maintain user engagement and growth.
