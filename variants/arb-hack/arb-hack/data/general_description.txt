Project Name: Alchemix

Project Description: Alchemix allows users to take a like-kind loan off of stablecoin and ETH collateral deployed in DeFi yield strategies. Because the loan is like-kind, and because the yield earned is used to repay the loan, the user experiences a non-liquidatable self-repaying loan. The set-and-forget nature of Alchemix loans creates long-term TVL and enables users to spend their loans off-chain for real-world use cases. Actual examples include buying a boat, wedding ring, timber mill, house down payments, and more!

Project Name: Copra

Project Description: Copra is the marketplace for fixed-yield protocol debts. Our fixed-rate loan’s initial use case is to help other DeFi protocol raise protocol-managed liquidity that they can deploy to 1) bootstrap new pools while reducing reliance to excessing token emission, and 2) enhance protocol income by taking the yield spread from performing strategies. For lenders, our loan is a simple way to earn fixed-yield with a protocol-level exposure, that is 1) secured on-chain by restricting funds deployment only to whitelisted pools, and 2) insured by buffers to cover against whitelisted pools drawdown and liquidity risks.

Because Yak Swap is fully on-chain and works via contract calls, it has 100% uptime and there is no proprietary API or server required to use it (so no external points of failure). Any trader can query the best price no matter who or where they are and protocols can even deploy their own Yak Swap router and enjoy on-chain price aggregation.

Yak Vaults & strategies are non-custodial auto-compounding vaults which allow users to benefit from socialised compound returns on their investments. Yak Vaults harness the power of a DEX aggregator (Yak Swap) when auto-compounding to get users the best price on their yield. Yield Yak also offer single-asset leverage strategies which optimise leverage to maximise potential yield from borrowing & lending rate.

 Project Name: Reserve Protocol

Project Description: Reserve is a free, permissionless platform on Ethereum mainnet (and Base L2, for now) to build, deploy and govern asset-backed currencies referred to as “RTokens.” RTokens are always 1:1 asset-backed, allowing for permissionless minting and redeeming onchain. For example, Electronic Dollar (eUSD) was the first RToken and is a safety-first stablecoin (backed by Aave and Compound deposits) that brings together diversified, highly liquid backing with anti-bank run overcollateralization that currently exceeds more than the value of the TVL of the RToken itself 4. eUSD has been chosen as the stablecoin for two retail user applications: 1) Ugly Cash 2 - an app that gives bank-like services to customers throughout LatAm, enabling them to receive USD remittance from the US at 0% fee and spend their eUSD with a debit card. 2) Sentz 1 - an app built on the MobileCoin blockchain that enables users to send and receive payments globally from anyone you can text for (basically) free.

Project Name: Stader Labs

Project Description: Stader is a non-custodial smart contract-based staking platform that helps you conveniently discover and access staking solutions. We are building key staking middleware infra for multiple PoS networks for retail crypto users, exchanges and custodians.

Stader’s liquid staking token on Ethereum (ETHx) has a unique design with multi-pool architecture that enables scalability and decentralization at the same time. Here are some key value propositions which make ETHx a game changer on the supply and demand side-

Decentralized LST on ETH - ETHx is a decentralized LST, which allows permissionless operators to validate. On the other hand, Lido is centralized and does not allow for permissionsless Operators to validate.
More Capital Efficient - Node operators can run nodes on ETHx with <80% of the current capital requirements. Capital requirements are 4.4 Eth with ETHx while they have to bond 32 Eth for solo staking, 10.4 Eth with RPL
Higher rewards - Stakers don’t have to choose from paying 50% extra commissions to closest competitor (RPL) while Stader’s commissions will be competitive at 10%
Supply Upside-
ETHx is a highly decentralized and censorship resistant liquid staking powered by 100s of unique node operators.
Offers Implicit slashing protection safeguarding user’s Eth against penalties and slashing i.e. users face no principal loss in case of any slashing events.
Demand Advantage- Leveraging partnerships with Ledger, OKX, and key DeFi players like Aave, Balancer, etc., will ensure sustainable TVL growth of ETHx and enhanced yields for ETHx users

Project Name: StakeWise

Project Description: StakeWise was the first non-custodial liquid staking solution to launch on Ethereum in early 2021. Following the launch of StakeWise V3, the protocol has transitioned into a fully white label liquid staking solution enabling any entity to leverage the StakeWise smart contract infrastructure to offer trustless, non-custodial staking-as-a-service. Alongside the V3 upgrade, osETH was launched as the protocol’s primary liquid staking token, creating a single-layer of composability across the StakeWise ecosystem. Whether it is a commercial operator offering liquid staking directly to their institutional clients or a solo staker liquid staking on their own node, osETH provides access to the DeFi ecosystem for everyone.
