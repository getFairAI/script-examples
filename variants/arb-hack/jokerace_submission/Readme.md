# Description

To optimize Arbitrum's incentive programs, we developed an AI system that assists Arbitrum decision-makers by utilizing both on-chain and off-chain data. We named this system DECIDE, and you can see how it would work in more detail [at this link](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?chainId=10&grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&role=community&isRenderingProposalBody=true&proposalId=66d1b7902047c84bb80fe75b).

For this hackathon, we created a PoC to prove this system's effectiveness. By analyzing data from various projects within the LTIPP incentive program, we generated an AI system capable of doing a report that addresses some of the most common questions posed by critical stakeholders in the Arbitrum forum and meetings.

Using a limited selection of data from the Arbitrum forum, the AI system can successfully identify patterns and extract insights similar to those found [in OpenBlock's report](https://www.openblocklabs.com/research/arbitrum-ltipp-efficacy-analysis). This demonstrates the effectiveness of the AI system and highlights the solution's potential when applied to a larger dataset.

We built this AI system on top of the FairAI marketplace, which means it is composable, verifiable, and transparent. We also implemented a chatbot where individuals can pose questions or discuss the generated reports with the AI system.
