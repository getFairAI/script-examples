# Problem
---

Analyzing the effectiveness of an incentive program at Arbitrum can be quite challenging. Even when dashboards and reports are available, understanding the data requires specific knowledge, and simply being able to read it often doesn't address the most critical questions. The same challenges arise when evaluating a grant proposal—there's often an overwhelming amount of information and not enough time and resources to analyze it effectively.

# Project Description
---

To optimize Arbitrum's incentive programs, we developed an AI system that assists Arbitrum decision-makers by utilizing both on-chain and off-chain data. We named this system Data-Enhanced Coordination for Intelligent Decision-making on Grants, or DECIDE for short. You can see how it would work in more detail [at this link](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?chainId=10&grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&role=community&isRenderingProposalBody=true&proposalId=66d1b7902047c84bb80fe75b).

For this hackathon, we created a PoC to prove this system's effectiveness. By analyzing data from various projects within the LTIPP incentive program, we generated an AI system capable of doing a report that addresses some of the most common questions posed by critical stakeholders in the Arbitrum forum and meetings.

Using a limited selection of data from the Arbitrum forum, the AI system can successfully identify patterns and extract insights similar to those found [in OpenBlock's report](https://www.openblocklabs.com/research/arbitrum-ltipp-efficacy-analysis). This demonstrates the effectiveness of the AI system and highlights the solution's potential when applied to a larger dataset.

We built this AI system on top of the FairAI marketplace, which means it is composable, verifiable, and transparent. We also implemented a chatbot where individuals can pose questions or discuss the generated reports with the AI system.
