# Problem and Context

Analyzing the effectiveness of an incentive program at Arbitrum can be quite challenging. Even when dashboards and reports are available, understanding the data requires specific knowledge, and simply being able to read it often doesn't address the most critical questions. Additionally, answering these questions may necessitate gathering information from various sources, which is typically not included in these dashboards and reports.

A clear example of this was seen in the LTIPP incentive program. Despite OpenBlock's efforts to collect data and information for evaluating the program, the Arbitrum stakeholders still struggled during [the call to present their findings](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1glTdpNX7s7HlnhkB3mfUcpyjlwybQU8h/view). They had difficulty getting their questions answered and understanding how to interpret the reports, data, and dashboards in order to draw meaningful conclusions.

To optimize Arbitrum's incentive programs, we designed an AI system that assists Arbitrum decision-makers by utilizing both on-chain and off-chain data. We named this system Data-Enhanced Coordination for Intelligent Decision-Making on Grants, or DECIDE for short. You can see how it would work in more detail [at this link](https://questbook.app/dashboard/?chainId=10&grantId=662f31c25488d5000f055a54&role=community&isRenderingProposalBody=true&proposalId=66d1b7902047c84bb80fe75b).

# Project Description

For this hackathon, we created a PoC to prove DECIDE's effectiveness. By analyzing just a limited selection of data from various projects within the LTIPP incentive program, we generated an AI system capable of producing a report that addresses questions posed by key members from the Arbitrum ecosystem in the forum and ArbitrumDAO meetings. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the AI system and highlights the solution's potential when applied to a larger dataset.

We built this AI system on top of the [FairAI marketplace](https://getfair.ai/), which means it is totally composable, verifiable, and transparent. Besides being way faster, cheaper, and trustless compared with mainstream reports, another advantage of a system like this is that individuals can pose questions, request summaries, or discuss the generated reports with the AI system. We also built a PoC for this feature for the hackathon:
